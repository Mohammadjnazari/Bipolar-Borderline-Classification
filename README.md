# EEG-Based Bipolar Disorder II and Borderline Personality Disorder Classification

This research project employs a multimodal machine learning approach, utilizing Electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and cognitive test results to distinguish between Bipolar Disorder II (BD II) and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The study involves the analysis of data collected from 45 participants.

## Key Findings

The classification model, implemented in Python, showcases the effectiveness of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, achieving a remarkable 93% balanced accuracy. Notably, EEG features played a pivotal role in the success of the classification method.

## Project Structure

- **Feature Extraction (`/m-files`):**
  - This directory contains MATLAB files (`*.m`) focused on the extraction of features from EEG data.

- **Classification Method (`MainClassificationForBipolarBorderline.ipynb`):**
  - The main classification method, developed in Python, is located in the `MainClassificationForBipolarBorderline.ipynb` directory. This script leverages the extracted features for distinguishing between BD II and BPD.

## Repository Contents

- `/m-files`: MATLAB files for EEG feature extraction.
- `/python-main-file`: Implementation of the classification method in Python.
- `/docs`: Documentation folder (if applicable).
